Merry Christmas   



I hope this Jade hardware wallet will bring you joy.



It will help you keep your magic internet money safe.  



Magic internet money is no joke.



It's a worthy life skill to know how to manage it.



I remember giving you 50 dollars worth when it was $3300 per bitcoin.  Now it is more than 10 times that.  I'll help you learn to protect it like it'll be worth 10 times more in the future because it probably will.



I will demo for you how I interact with my Jade to create wallets, send and receive transactions, restore a wallet, etc so that you feel comfortable interacting on the main chain, the liquid side chain and the lightning network which are all part of the broader bitcoin ecosystem.



Along with this Jade is me volunteering to be your bitcoin help desk.
